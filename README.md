Payroller is the web page where the users can receive detailed information about the taxes 
and other related contributions to the state budget.

The treasure transactions, mostly, are made by the employers on behalf of the employees. 
As a result, the employees do not have enough information concerning the amounts they contribute 
to financing state authorities and are less demanding of state governance.
